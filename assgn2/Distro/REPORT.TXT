Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (5 marks) Explain the design of your utility function.
     Describe all the factors that influence its value, and
     how their influence was evaluated and integrated into
     a single, meaningful value. Convince us that your utility
     makes sense!

     The utility first checks how close to the closest cheese the next location is, and subtracts the manhattan distance
     because this will incentivice going in the direction that lowers distance to cheese. Then we look at how close the
     closest cat is, and add the manhattan distance, so places that are further from a cat will have a higher value.
     Lastly, we give lower utility to squares that are surrounded by walls, because those are dead ends and we do not want
     to go there unless there is cheese there. Edge cases that are also considered are if the cheese is in that spot, then
     we return a very high value, unless there is a cat very close, then we want to prioritize running from the cat.

2 .- (2 marks) Ignoring computation time, what is the effect of
     search depth (number of turns) on the chances of the mouse
     winning the game.
     
     The higher the depth, the more likely the mouse was of finding a terminal node and getting the cheese.

3 .- (2 marks) What situations will cause your mouse to lose?
     can these be fixed either with the utility function, or
     by changing the search depth? if so, how?

     If the mouse is surrounded by cats in all possible directions then he will lose, this cannot be fixed
     because its a losing situation no matter what move is made.
     Mouse will also lose sometimes when the cats move randomly, because it will keep thinking they are playing optimally
     so it will choose moves in a basically random fashion too, so it will never get the cheese. This can be fixed by increasing
     the search depth, because then the mouse will know where the cheese is.

4 .- (2 marks) Compare cats with smartness=.8 against cats with
     smartness=1 - which are harder for your mouse to beat?
     why do you think that is?
     
     The lower the difficulty the harder it is for the mouse to win, because the mouse is always assuming the
     cats are making optimal moves, but if they move at random then the mouse will go to a spot it thinks is
     the best, but then the cat could randomly move to a different one and mess up the path.

5 .- (2 marks) Can the mouse be made unbeatable by having an
     optimal utility function?
     No there are still cases where the mouse just does not have a winning strategy. The utility function only tells
     how optimal a move is, it doesn't create optimal moves, so if the mouse is trapped to begin with, it will still
     die.

6 .- (2 bonus marks) Could a human playing the game in place
      of the mouse do better than your code? (yes, no, and
      a reasonable explanation of why)
      Yes, the mouse is reliant on the cat to make it move and does not do much if the cat is far away as all paths
      are pretty safe, but a human can realize that when the cat is far you can do a lot and go for the cheese.

Marking:

(10 marks) Implemented a non-trivial, clever, and
           effective utility function. It allows the
           mouse to win the game often. 

(10 marks) Correctly implementing MiniMax. The algorithm
           should produce the expected behaviour. The
           mouse should take a reasonable path to the
           cheese and avoid cats. The cats will try to
           catch the mouse. Mouse is not easy to catch.

(10 marks) Implemented alpha-beta pruning. The algorithm
           significantly reduces the amount of search
           while producing identical results as those
           from standard MiniMax 

(15 marks) Competitive (TA assigned) based on how smart
           your mouse is (this is related to your
           utility function above!)
